                <p>Manufacturing is emerging as an integral pillar in the country’s economic growth, thanks to the performance of key sectors like automotive, engineering, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and consumer durables. The Indian manufacturing industry generated 16-17% of India’s GDP pre-pandemic and is projected to be one of the fastest growing sectors.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The machine tool industry was literally the nuts and bolts of the manufacturing industry in India. Today, technology has stimulated innovation with digital transformation a key aspect in gaining an edge in this highly competitive market.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Technology has today encouraged creativity, with digital transformation being a critical element in gaining an advantage in this increasingly competitive industry. The Indian manufacturing sector is steadily moving toward more automated and process-driven manufacturing, which is projected to improve efficiency and enhance productivity.</p>
                <br>
                <p>India's manufacturing sector reached a 16-year high in March, with the HSBC Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rising to 59.1, driven by strong increases in output, new orders, and job creation across various goods sectors.</p>

                <p>India has the potential to become a global manufacturing hub for wind power components. India is well-positioned to cater to 10% of the global wind energy demand by 2030, leveraging its manufacturing capacity, technology, and global reputation.</p>
                <br>
                <p>With 17% of the nation’s GDP and over 27.3 million workers, the manufacturing sector plays a significant role in the Indian economy. Through the implementation of different programmes and policies, the Indian government hopes to have 25% of the economy’s output come from manufacturing by 2025.</p>
                <br>
                <p>India now has the physical and digital infrastructure to raise the share of the manufacturing sector in the economy and make a realistic bid to be an important player in global supply chains.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A globally competitive manufacturing sector is India's greatest potential to drive economic growth and job creation this decade. Due to factors like power growth, long-term employment prospects, and skill routes for millions of people, India has a significant potential to engage in international markets. Several factors contribute to their potential. First off, these value chains are well positioned to benefit from India's advantages in terms of raw materials, industrial expertise, and entrepreneurship.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Second, they can take advantage of four market opportunities: expanding exports, localising imports, internal demand, and contract manufacturing. With digital transformation being a crucial component in achieving an advantage in this fiercely competitive industry, technology has today sparked creativity. Manufacturing sector in India is gradually shifting to a more automated and process driven manufacturing which is expected to increase the efficiency and boost production of the manufacturing industry.</p>
                <br>
                <p>India is gradually progressing on the road to Industry 4.0 through the Government of India’s initiatives like the National Manufacturing Policy which aims to increase the share of manufacturing in GDP to 25 percent by 2025 and the PLI scheme for manufacturing which was launched in 2022 to develop the core manufacturing sector at par with global manufacturing standards.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs , Ms. Nirmala Sitharaman announced the "National Manufacturing Mission" in the Union Budget 2025-26 to boost "Make in India" by supporting industries of all sizes with policy frameworks, ease of business, MSME growth, future-ready workforce, and clean tech manufacturing.</p>
                <br>
                <p>According to MeitY, India’s digital economy is projected to grow at twice the rate of the overall economy, accounting for 20% of the national income by 2029-30, surpassing both agriculture and manufacturing, driven by digital platforms and widespread digitalisation across sectors.</p>

                <p>FDI in India's manufacturing sector has reached Rs. 14,34,224 crore (US$ 165.1 billion), a 69% increase over the past decade, driven by production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes. In the last five years, total FDI inflows amounted to Rs. 33,31,465 crore (US$ 383.5 billion).</p>
                <br>
                <p>India is planning to offer incentives of up to Rs. 18,000 crore (US$ 2.2 billion) to spur local manufacturing in six new sectors including chemicals, shipping containers, and inputs for vaccines.</p>
